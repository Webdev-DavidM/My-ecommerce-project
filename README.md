This project is my first project which I have created from scratch with no guidance either by a tutorial or as part of a course. I have used React (class-based components) and Redux for state management, Node and Express on the back-end with nosql MongoDB as a database. I use JWT tokens to authenticate users and protect routes.

Please site can be found at the link below, logging as an administrator gives access to an admin screen where you can create, edit or delete products on the database and also access customer orders
